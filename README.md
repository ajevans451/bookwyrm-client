### Planning Story
Work began on the front-end after the completion of the back-end. I started by testing the communication with the locally-hosted API with the user resource actions. Then, I created the components for the primary resource, listing. I added any new components to the router as I worked to allow an authenticated user to be able to view and create new listings and edit and delete listings they owned. When errors presented themselves, I first probed the front-end for their source before moving to check the back-end. Most errors were able to be resolved before I needed to check the back-end.
